# BareMetal x86 OS - Boschs Simulator

In this repository you will find my progress in BareMetal x86 programming.

The last example (tp_15) shows one possible implementation of a very basic OS capable of switch between different tasks with SIMD usage.

You will be able to find what each tp_xx is about in the pdf called "tp_td3_2020_1_v1_0"
