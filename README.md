# BareMetal x86 OS - Boschs Simulator

In this repository you will find my progress in BareMetal x86 programming.

Take in mind that you will need to first **install** the "**Bochs IA-32 Emulator Project**" program. You can find it in the following [link](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/getcurrent.html "link")

You will be able to find what each tp_01_xx is about in the pdf called "**tp_td3_2020_1_v1_0**". The language of the file is **SPANISH**.

Everything is programmed in **Assembler**. Some functions are programmed in C, but implemented from the assemble code.

The last example (tp_15) shows one possible implementation of a very basic OS capable of switch between different tasks with SIMD usage.
