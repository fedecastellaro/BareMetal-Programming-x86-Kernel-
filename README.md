# BareMetal x86 OS - Boschs Simulator

In this repository you will find my progress in BareMetal x86 programming.

Take in mind that you will need to first **install** the "**Bochs IA-32 Emulator Project**" program. You can find it in the following [link](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/getcurrent.html "link")
You can also follow the instructions in this [link](http://wiki.electron.frba.utn.edu.ar/doku.php?id=td3:bochs "link") to implement your own simulation of a PC with 512MB of RAM, 64kB of ROM, and a generic x86 processor.

You will be able to find what each tp_01_xx is about in the pdf called "**tp_td3_2020_1_v1_0**". The language of the file is **SPANISH**.

Everything is programmed in **Assembler**. Some functions are programmed in C, but implemented from the assemble code.

The last example (tp_01_15) shows one possible implementation of a very basic OS capable of switch between different tasks with SIMD usage.
